<!--
    This file allows freedesktop.org-compliant desktops (such as GNOME and
    KDE) to know which files should be opened by what program (and what icon
    to show for the file in a file browser).

    Both magic and file name glob patterns are supported; glob patterns are
    preferred since they don't require opening and reading part of
    the file to determine its type.

    The specification for this file can be found here:
    https://standards.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/latest/


    Note that ideally the MIME types listed here should be IANA-registered:

    https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml

    If your file type is not registered then using one of the
    (not-really-a-good-idea and deprecated) x- media types is the only option
    if you want files to be associated with Wireshark in
    freedesktop.org-compliant file browsers.


    NOTE: if you do add a MIME type here, don't forget to add it to the list
    of MIME types handled by Wireshark in org.wireshark.Logray.desktop.
